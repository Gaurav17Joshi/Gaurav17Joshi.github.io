Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an incoming `MSCS student at UC San Diego (Fall 2025)` with a background in `Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and AI`.  
My journey has taken me through research in inverse rendering and generative modeling, open-source contributions through Google Summer of Code, and even the co-founding of a voice-based AI startup.  

Iâ€™m broadly interested in pushing the boundaries of how AI systems perceive, generate, and interact with the visual world.
